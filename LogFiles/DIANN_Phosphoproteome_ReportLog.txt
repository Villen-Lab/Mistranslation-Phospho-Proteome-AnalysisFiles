Thread number set to 16
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Library precursors will be reannotated using the FASTA database
XICs within 10 seconds from the apex will be extracted for each precursor and saved in .parquet format, a folder will be created next to the main report for the XICs storage
Peptides corresponding to protein sequence IDs tagged with cRAP- will be excluded from normalisation as well as quantification of protein groups that do not include proteins bearing the tag
N-terminal methionine excision enabled
Min peptide length set to 7
Max peptide length set to 50
Min precursor m/z set to 300
Max precursor m/z set to 1800
Min precursor charge set to 1
Max precursor charge set to 4
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Maximum number of missed cleavages set to 2
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 3
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:21 with mass delta 79.9663 at STY will be considered as variable
Peptidoform scoring enabled
The spectral library (if generated) will retain the original spectra but will include empirically-aligned RTs
full quantification information will be exported in .parquet format
DIA-NN will automatically optimise the mass accuracy for the first run of the experiment, use this mode for preliminary analyses only
The following variable modifications will be localised: UniMod:35 UniMod:21
